Thank you for registering for the People-Powered Medicine {{ ppm_study_title }} study.  As you may be aware, we are just beginning recruitment, and we are excited to have received so much interest and support in such a short period of time.  Before accepting a participant into the study, we need to review the registration answers for each person who registers to determine eligibility.  Because of the positive publicity and support we have received, we have many potential participants to review, so please allow up to 8 weeks for us to update you on your registration.

In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.  Thank you again for your interest in our study!
